# Cloud9 Workspace Templates

Welcome to the open source repository for all public Cloud9 workspace templates.

## Building your own

Suggesting an update to an existing template or proposing a new one is super simple:

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/c9/templates)
2. Create a new folder based on `ws-default` and name it `ws-YOUR_TEMPLATE`
3. Update the Dockerfile with all dependencies you'd like to install
4. Open a PR (Pull Request) and of course, profit!
